I am interested in understanding the factors that have shaped behavior across both cultural and evolutionary timescales. I am also interested in the potential macro-evolutionary consequences of these processes. To explore these questions, I study the communication systems of various taxa (i.e. [hummingbirds, [wrens](https://marce10.github.io/category/wrens/), [bats](https://marce10.github.io/category/bats/)), with a particular focus on [neotropical species](https://marce10.github.io/category/neotropical/). My research combines [single-species behavioral studies](https://marce10.github.io/category/behavioral-ecology/), [comparative phylogenetic analyses](https://marce10.github.io/category/phylogenetic-comparative-analysis/), and custom data analysis through [scientific programming](https://marce10.github.io/category/scientific-programming/).

I also develop [software packages for analyzing behavioral data](https://marce10.github.io/software/). I created the R packages [warbleR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=warbleR), which provides functions to streamline high-throughput acoustic analysis of animal sounds, and [Rraven](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Rraven) which simplifies the integration of [Raven Pro](https://www.ravensoundsoftware.com/) (a sound annotation software) for bioacustic analysis workflows in R. I also created the R packages [baRulho](https://cran.r-project.org/package=baRulho), to quantify acoustic signal transmission and degradation, and [ohun](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ohun), to optimize automatic detection. I am currently expanding this ecosystem with two new packages: [suwo](https://github.com/maRce10/suwo/), for accessing nature media repositories through R and [PhenotypeSpace](https://marce10.github.io/PhenotypeSpace/), for quantifying features of multivariate phenotypic spaces.
